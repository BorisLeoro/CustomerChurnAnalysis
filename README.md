This is a sample customer churn analysis. It includes churn by contract type (month to month, two year, one year) churn rate and target churn rate, and a decomposition tree of count of churn by tenure, contract, and internet service. 
Some actionable insights are that month to month contracts have much higher churn rates and fiber optic users on month to month plans are a churn hot spot.
Recommendations: offer loyalty discounts for month to month customers, or do longer fiber optic contracts.
